        <p>
            I'm a Senior Product Manager with over 8 years of experience building customer-centric solutions 
            that drive real business impact. My journey from Law & Justice studies to product leadership 
            has given me a unique perspective on problem-solving and stakeholder communication.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            At <strong>Assurance IQ</strong>, I orchestrated product strategy that saved $2M in policyholder LTV 
            and improved customer retention by 20%. Previously at <strong>Cineplex</strong>, I led the product team 
            that grew monthly active users by 140% and drove revenue from $2M to $11M over 3 years.
        </p>

            I launched <strong>Canada's largest Native Advertising Network</strong> at Postmedia, generating 
            $1.5M in the first 5 months and $12M in the first year. My approach combines rigorous customer 
            research with data-driven decision making to build products people actually want to use.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Currently, I'm exploring AI systems and building memory architectures for enhanced human-computer 
            interaction. I'm also deepening my technical skills through Python and SQL bootcamps, believing 
            that great product managers should understand the technology they're building.
